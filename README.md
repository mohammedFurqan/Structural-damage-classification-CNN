# Structural-damage-classification-CNN

Using CNN models to classify the damage type from the images. 

Several popular models were used to build a baseline model to classify the images on various aspects, such as:
- Damage Type
- Damage Level
- Spalling Condition
- Collapse Mode

After having baseline models, the models were tuned to obtain improved results, as below:
- Adding Regularisation
- Ratio of trainable/frozen top layers
- Drop-out rate
- Learning rate and decay
